                                                             AJAX

    1. Ajax is a Asynchronous Javascript and XML(eXtensible Markup Language).
    2. XML is format of data which is deprecated now
    3. We will learn how to make HTTP Requests to server in backend (HTTP is the way to communicate with the server)
    4. Ajax is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on "client-side" to create asynchronous web applications.
    5. With ajax, we apps can send and retrieve data from server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering the display of web page
    6. We dont use XML format anymore, instead modern way is to JSON now.
    7. We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
        1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing).
        2. fetch API (new way of doing).
        3. axios (Third party library).
    8. Data fetching flow :
        🧑‍💻 (User)   (Initiates the action (like opening the page or clicking a button).)
                |
                v
        💻 [HTML + JS Page]     (HTML provides the structure (buttons, list, etc.)JavaScript handles logic (events, AJAX, DOM updates).)
                |
                v
        🖱️ Click -> 🔁 AJAX (fetch/axios)   (JS listens for the click (addEventListener). On click, JS starts an asynchronous operation → AJAX (fetch() or axios))
                |
                v
        📡 HTTP Request (POST/GET/etc.) Every API comes with methods which are mentioned in its documentation
            (
                JS sends HTTP request to server.
                    GET → get data (browser by default make GET request)
                    POST → send new data
                    PUT → update data
                    PATCH → update part of data
                    DELETE → remove data
            )
                |
                v
        🌐 Server (CRUD + DB)
            (
                Reads the request
                    Applies CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                    Sends back data (usually in JSON format)
            )
                |
                v
        📩 JSON Response    (JS receives data asynchronously (without page reload))
                |
                v
        🧠 JS updates HTML (DOM)    (JS takes that data and dynamically updates the web page)
