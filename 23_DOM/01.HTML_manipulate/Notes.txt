                                                        JavaScript DOM
                                             --------------------------------------

(CaC)
1. DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents like HTML and XML. The DOM represents the page so that programs (like JavaScript) can read, manipulate, and update the structure, style, and content dynamically.

2. console.log(window); => it prints the window object, which represents the global object in a web browser.
   2.1 It is the top-level object in the browser's JavaScript environment.
   2.2 It represents the browser window or tab.
   2.3 All global JavaScript variables and functions are actually properties of window.

3.  What You See in the Console:
The browser will display a collapsible object labeled Window that contains hundreds of properties and methods. Some of the common ones include:

        Property / Method	       |              Description
    document	                   |  The DOM of the page (window.document)
    location	                   |  Info about the current URL
    navigator	                   |  Info about the browser (user agent, platform, etc.)
    console	                      |  The console object (for logging, errors, etc.)
    alert()	                      |  Shows a popup alert
    setTimeout()	                |  Runs a function after a delay
    setInterval()	                |  Runs a function repeatedly at intervals
    innerWidth, innerHeight	    |  Size of the window viewport
    localStorage / sessionStorage |	Storage mechanisms
    fetch()	                      |  For making network requests
    history	                      |  Controls browser session history


JS DOM (CodeHelp)
   1. window object is global object which it a topmost object in JS

   2. window object is created by browser, like if we type window.open() and window.close() then it will open and close window respectively

   3. DOM (Document Object Model) : when we convert html code into JavaScript's object then that code is called a Document and overall conversion 
      (HTML code -> JS Object (which is called a document)) it is called a DOM

   4. tag -> token(with the help of tockeniser) -> node, and these node will create DOM i.e. tree like structure
      How HTML is converted to the DOM:
         When you load an HTML file in the browser, here's what happens under the hood:
         1. **Tag**:
            - The browser reads the raw HTML source code, which includes elements like:
               <div>, <h1>, <p>, <script>, etc.
         2. **Token**:
            - The **HTML parser** (specifically, the **tokenizer**) breaks these tags into **tokens**.
            - A token represents the start or end of an element, attributes, or text content.
         Example:
            <p class="intro">Hello</p>
            => Tokens: 
            - StartTagToken (p)
            - AttributeToken (class="intro")
            - TextToken ("Hello")
            - EndTagToken (</p>)
         3. **Node**:
            - The browser converts these tokens into **nodes**.
            - These nodes represent elements, text, comments, etc., in a structured format.
            Types of nodes include:
            - Element nodes (like `<div>`, `<p>`)
            - Text nodes (like "Hello")
            - Comment nodes (like `<!-- comment -->`)
         4. **DOM Tree**:
            - The nodes are organized into a **tree-like structure** known as the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.
            - This tree mirrors the nesting and hierarchy of the HTML document.
            - JavaScript can then interact with this DOM using the `document` object.
         Example:
            <div>
               <p>Hello</p>
            </div>
            DOM Tree:
            - div (Element node)
               └─ p (Element node)
                   └─ "Hello" (Text node)
         So the full flow is:
         HTML Tag ➝ Token ➝ Node ➝ DOM Tree (JavaScript-accessible structure)

   5. Difference between Document and DOM
      Document = HTML code that gets converts into JS Object is called document
      DOM = It is a tree like structure formed with the help of multiple HTML nodes

   6. BOM (Browser Object Model) : It allows JavaScript to interact with the browser outside the webpage, such as:
                                   The window (browser tab)
                                   The navigator (browser info)
                                   The location (URL)
                                   The history (back/forward navigation)
                                   The screen (screen size, resolution)
      BOM = JavaScript’s way to talk to the browser itself (not the web page)

   7. Example :-
      1. Simple HTML Page
         <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
               <head>
                  <title>My Page</title>
               </head>
               <body>
                  <h1>Hello World</h1>
                  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
               </body>
            </html>
      
      2. What the document Represents (Rough Structure in JS Terms)
         document = {
            location: { ... },
            title: "My Page",
            body: {
               tagName: "BODY",
               children: [
                  {
                     tagName: "H1",
                     innerText: "Hello World"
                  },
                  {
                    tagName: "P",
                    innerText: "This is a paragraph."
                  }
               ]
            },
            head: {
               children: [
                  {
                    tagName: "TITLE",
                    innerText: "My Page"
                  }
               ]
            },
         }

         3. DOM Tree Representation
         Document
            └── html
               ├── head
               │   └── title ("My Page")
               └── body
                  ├── h1 ("Hello World")
                  └── p ("This is a paragraph.")

   8. DOM Manipulation : 
      1. Fetching/Accessing element of the HTML 
                     ├── id = document.getElementById();
                     ├── className = document.getElementsByClassName();
                     ├── TagName = document.getElementsByTagName();
                     ├── querySelector = 1. document.querySelector(); (but when we try to target class that class is defined in multiple tags then it 
                                                                   will only return first class amongst them)
                                         2. (it will select all the elements of same class)
                                         by using querySelector() and querySelectorAll(), we can target elements directly by . for class , # for id
                                                                  and directly by tag name
                                         E.g. document.querySelector(".textArea");
                     ├── $0 = when select any element by clicking on it then on its HTML $0 appears and then go to console and type $0 then it will 
                              return whole element
      2. Update element of the HTML
                     ├── innerHTML -> use to get/set inner HTML of any tag/element, 
                                      get = target an element by cursor and click on it & type $0 console in to see, then store $0 in variable, then 
                                            access variable.innerHTML, it will show the tag inside that particular tag
                                      set = variable.innerHTML = "<p>Hello ji</p>" (It changes content of the element)
                     ├── outerHTML -> use to get/set inner HTML of any tag/element, 
                                      get = target an element by cursor and click on it & type $0 console in to see, then store $0 in variable, then 
                                            access variable.outerHTML, it will show the tag outside that particular Tag
                                      set = variable.outerHTML = "<p>This is outer html</p>" (It changes content of the element)
                     ├── textContent -> use to get/set the raw text inside an element.
                                        get = target an element by cursor and click on it & type $0 console in to see, then store $0 in variable,  
                                              then access variable.textContent, text content with line breaks spaces and enter
                                        set = variable.textContent = "<p>This is text content</p>"
                     ├── innerText -> use to get/set the visible text inside an element.
                                        get = target an element by cursor and click on it & type $0 console in to see, then store $0 in variable,  
                                              then access variable.innerText, pure text content without line breaks spaces and enter
                                        set = variable.innerText = "<p>This is inner text</p>"
      3. Insert/add element to the HTML
                     ├──createElement -> .appendChild()
                     Creating an element = document.createElement("tagName"); and store it in variable
                                           e.g. let heading = document.createElement("h1");
                     adding content to element = heading.textContent = "This is SKR";
                     adding element in HTML = let bodyTag = document.querySelector("body"); (<- this will use to make child of particular tag)
                                              bodyTag.appendChild(heading) (<- it will use to add create element in particular tag)
                                              (But this will add element at last of body tag)
                     So, to add element at our desired position we neet to use, we need to use another methods
                     ├──insertAdjacentElement()

                                                ├── 1. beforeBegin -> add element before beginnig of element (outside before starting of element)
                              ├── 1. position├──├── 2. afterBegin  -> add element at start of element (inside at start of specified element)
                              ├                 ├── 3. beforeEnd   -> add element before ending of element (inside at end of specified element)
                              ├                 ├── 4. afterEnd    -> add element after ending of element (outside specified element end)
                              ├     
                              ├     
                              ├── 2. which HTML element you want to add (HTML content)

      4. Removal of element (it is opposite of appendChild())
                     ├──removeChild() (we must know parent and child to perform this)
                              ├──let parent = document.querySelector("class or id of parent");
                                 let child = document.querySelector("class or id of child");
                                 parent.removeChild(child);

                     Finding parent element using child element : 
                        let child = document.querySelector(".childClass");
                        let parent = child.parentElement;
                        console.log(parent);
