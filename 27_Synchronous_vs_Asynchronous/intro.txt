                                            Synchronous vs Asynchrnous code

1. Introduction to Synchronous and Asynchrnous code
A. Synchronous - it runs line by line (ek kaam start hoke finish hoga uske baad hi agla kaam shuru hoga)
example - 
    code A - 5 seconds      = This code will run and finish in 5 seconds 
    code B - 2 seconds      = Then this code will run and finish in 2 seconds
    code C - 11 seconds     = Then this code will run and finish in 11 seconds
    code D - 3 seconds      = Then this code will run and finish in 3 seconds
                            Total time required to finish all these tasks is 5 + 2 + 11 + 3 = 21 seconds

B. Asynchrnous - It runs code all together (saare kaam ek sath shuru kardo, jiska answer pehle aa jaye uska jawaab de dedena)
example - 
    code A - 5 seconds      = This code will run and finish in 5 seconds 
    code B - 2 seconds      = This code will run and finish in 2 seconds
    code C - 11 seconds     = This code will run and finish in 11 seconds
    code D - 3 seconds      = This code will run and finish in 3 seconds
                            Total time required to finish all these tasks is 11 seconds


2. How to know if code is Synchronous or Asynchrnous code?
Asynchrnous : 
    setTimeout
    setInterval
    Promise
    XMLHttpRequest
    fetch
    axios
if we are using any of these in code then it will become Asynchrnous code otherwise it will be Synchronous code.

3. What is Asynchrnous JS code?
Sometime our final code depends on another's server, and in this case we don't know about how much time it will require to give answer
so Asynchronous JS is a JavaScript code that doesn't execute in a strict top-to-bottom order — instead, it allows certain operations (like data fetching or timers) to happen in the background, without blocking the main thread. This helps keep your application fast and responsive.

4. Sending and Receiving data of Asynchrnous code : 
for sending - setTimeout, setInterval, Promise, XMLHttpRequest, fetch, axios
    "Sending" means Initiating Asynchronous Operations
    Method	            Purpose	Example Usage
    setTimeout()	    Runs code after a delay	setTimeout(() => {}, 1000)
    setInterval()	    Runs code repeatedly on interval	setInterval(() => {}, 1000)
    Promise	            Represents a future value	new Promise((resolve) => {})
    XMLHttpRequest	    Makes HTTP requests	xhr.open('GET', url)
    fetch()	Makes       HTTP requests	fetch('url')
    axios()	Makes       HTTP requests (library)	axios.get('url')

for receiving - then catch, callbacks, async await, onreadystatechange, event listeners
    "Receiving" means Handling the Response or Result
    Method	                    Works With	                                        Purpose
    .then()	                    Promises / fetch / axios	                        Handle successful result
    .catch()	                Promises / fetch / axios	                        Handle errors
    callbacks                   setTimeout, setInterval, custom async functions	    Handle result via function passed as parameter
    async/await	                Promises	                                        Cleaner syntax for handling async code
    onreadystatechange	        XMLHttpRequest	                                    Handle response state changes
    event listeners	            Asynchronous events	                                Handle results like load, click, etc.
