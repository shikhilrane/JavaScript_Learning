There are two types of languages 
    1. Interpreted languages = 
        Code runs line by line
        Code is read and executed line by line
        Slower in performance
        No prior compilation step
        Example: Python, older JavaScript engines
    2. Compiled languages = 
        Code first checked then it gets run later
        Code is translated into machine code before execution
        Faster execution
        Example: C, C++, Java (compiled to bytecode first)

JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, but with modern engines, it's also compiled
JavaScript is both interpreted and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled.
                        |JS FILE| -> |PARSER| -> |AST| -> |CONVERSION TO M/C CODE| -> |CONVERTED M/C CODE| -> |CODE RUNS|
                                        |
                                        V
According to ECMA, early error checking and scope of variable should be defined before running the code so JIT is compiler is used here

Global Execution Context : 
    1. Creation Phase : Creation of itself.
    2. Code Execution Phase : Phase in which code is executed.
